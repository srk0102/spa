Modify the Cracker Barrel Prolog program given


to work on a smaller board with only 4 rows. Instead of looking like this:

    .
   x x
  x x x
 x x x x 
x x x x x 
 
the board on which your program runs, should look like this:

    .
   x x
  x x x
 x x x x 
 
Will it still be possible to have only one peg remaining on the board, for all initial configurations? If not, give a counter-example, i.e., and initial board configuration for which your program cannot achieve this result.

Submit your solution on canvas as as a self-contained .pro file, with your explanations and test output pasted as a /* .. */ comment at the end of your code.
